# Graphing-Q-value-vs-time-to-get-max-Q-

During the broadcast of a rocket launch,about 30 seconds after liftoff, we hear that the announcer indicates that the rocket is lowering the throttles for “Max Q” or maximum dynamic pressure. 

Max Q represents the maximum pressure exerted on the rocket by the air as the rocket moves through the atmosphere. We have used the Matplotlib library to graphically represent pressure as a function of time to understand where Max Q occurs and what the total pressure is at Max Q for Unha3 (South Korena rocket which failed the initial launch ). Dynamic pressure is a function of the density of air (which changes with altitude and temperature) and velocity (which will change with time as the rocket speeds up).

We have used the equations for rocket where we assume that the mass burning rate is constant and the velcity of exhaust too constant. 

The equations have been taken from https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/atmos.html
The inputs have been collected from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unha
